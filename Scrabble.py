'''
Currently:
> refactoring implementation of makeMove into Player
> expressing passing all Game attributes through the object of Game

To do:
> Refactor implementation of makeMove into Player as much as possible.
 > Try to get it to the point where Game simply has to call the takeTurn method from Player
 > This will later be useful when coding the AI

> Seperate out the private and public variables and use getters and setters where appropriate
 > The need for this is likely going to be low as most of the variables are passed down in this implementation

> Properly comment your code!

> Create a scoring system for the plays made
 > Implement this in the board class
 > If you want to be secure about this, the Player and Scrabble classes should be the only ones directly accessed by the user
  > I.e. through the GUI
